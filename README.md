## Motivation

When you are inside a Vue component, it is not easy to find all the places where this component is used. This extension will help you to find all the places where the component is used by searching for the component name in all the files in your project.

## Usage

This extension adds a new command to the Command Palette: `Find Vue Component Usages`. You can also bind a keyboard shortcut to this command if you like.
